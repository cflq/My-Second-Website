            Why do I like chess ?
            Chess is the only game I really enjoy because it’s 100% about skill—there’s no luck involved at all,
            and that’s what makes it special to me.
            It’s all about thinking ahead, planning your moves,
            and trying to outsmart your opponent.
            it’s one of the best games for sharpening your mind.
            I’ve been into it for about a year and a half,
            I’ve learned a lot during that time.
            My favorite openings are the Queen’s Gambit when I play as White and the Sicilian Defense when I’m Black they give me the feeling of being in control of the game from the start.
            I also like exploring the difference between Queen’s Gambit Accepted and Declined because the strategies behind them are so interesting.
            It’s amazing how chess is both simple and complex at the same time,
            with only 64 squares but endless possibilities.
            It’s one of the best ways to challenge myself and improve.

                My Favorite piece in chess is the Knight, I call it Horsey.<br>
                I enjoy listening to The Weeknd.<br>
                Last year, I’ve found that I’m pretty good at volleyball,
                which makes playing it really enjoyable for me.
                I started learning graphic design last year,
                even though I was only using my mobile. Despite that,
                I’ve made noticeable progress,
                and now I’m planning to take it further by learning how to design using my PC to improve my skills even more.
                <br>The thing that is interesting about programming is that it seems so logical to me,
                I used to read some codes and understand them even if I had no knowledge about the language.
