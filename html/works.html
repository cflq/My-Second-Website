            SO WHAT ARE YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS ?
        </span><br><br>
        Since I’m new to coding and didn’t have a PC before,
        I spent my time creating designs using my phone.
        I don’t have many achievements yet,
        but I’m really excited to accomplish a lot in the future.
        I’d say I’m pretty good at English,
        even though I use ChatGPT to help polish my paragraphs and make them look cooler.
        Oh, and since I’m working on this website,
        I guess we can count that as an achievement too!
        </p>
        
        <p class="descriptions"><span class="INFO" id="career">WHAT ARE THE DESIGNS YOU'VE MADE ?</span><br><br>
            Most of them aren't that good but I'm sending some pictures here :<br><br>

                My Favorite piece in chess is the Knight, I call it Horsey.<br>
                I enjoy listening to The Weeknd.<br>
                Last year, I’ve found that I’m pretty good at volleyball,
                which makes playing it really enjoyable for me.
                I started learning graphic design last year,
                even though I was only using my mobile. Despite that,
                I’ve made noticeable progress,
                and now I’m planning to take it further by learning how to design using my PC to improve my skills even more.
                <br>The thing that is interesting about programming is that it seems so logical to me,
                I used to read some codes and understand them even if I had no knowledge about the language.
